<!--
The template defines the view of the component - what is actually rendered.
In NativeScript applications the template is defined with XML using NativeScript UI elements.
It is different from HTML. So instead of <input>, <span>, <div> etc. - we have <TextField>, <Label> and layouts.
The important thing is that although the elements are different - all of the Angular’s template syntax works exactly the same.
So you can still use template expressions, bindings, templates as well as all the built-in directives.

The ActionBar is the NativeScript common abstraction over the Android ActionBar and iOS NavigationBar.
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/action-bar
-->
<ActionBar title="My App" class="action-bar">
</ActionBar>

<!--
The StackLayout stacks UI components on the screen — either vertically or horizontally.
In this case, the StackLayout does vertical stacking; you can change the stacking to
horizontal by applying a orientation="horizontal" attribute to the <StackLayout> element.
You can learn more about NativeScript layouts at https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/layout-containers.

These components make use of several CSS class names that are part of the NativeScript
core theme, such as p-20, btn, h2, and list-group. You can view a full list of the
class names available for styling your app at https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.

<StackLayout class="page">

          <StackLayout orientation="horizontal" class="p-x-10" [nsRouterLink]="['/', item.id]">
